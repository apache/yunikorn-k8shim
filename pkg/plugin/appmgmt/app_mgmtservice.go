// a common interface for applications' operator service
// an operator service monitors the lifecycle the applications,
// it is responsible for reporting application status to the scheduler,
// that helps the scheduler to manage the application lifecycle natively.
type AppManagementService interface {
	// the name of this application service
	// this info is exposed to the scheduler so we know what kind of apps
	// the scheduler is able to supervise.
	Name() string

	// if the service needs to init any objects, this is the place
	// the initialization of the service must not start any of go routines,
	// this will be called before starting the service.
	ServiceInit() error

	// if the service has some internal stuff to run, this is the place to run them
	// usually if an application is defined as K8s CRD, the operator service needs
	// to watch on these CRD events. the CRD informers can be launched here.
	// some implementation may not need to implement this.
	Start() error

	// if there is some go routines running in start, properly stop them while
	// the stop() function is called.
	Stop() error

	// why we need a recoveryApplication API here?
	// the scheduler is stateless, all states are maintained just in memory,
	// so each time when scheduler restarts, it needs to recover apps and nodes states from scratch.
	// nodes state will be taken care of by the scheduler itself, however for apps state recovery,
	// the scheduler will need to call this function for every allocated pod, app management service
	// needs to implement this accordingly.
