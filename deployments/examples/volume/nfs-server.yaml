# Note - an NFS server isn't really a Kubernetes concept.
# We're just creating it in Kubernetes for illustration and convenience.
# In practice it might be run in some other system.
# Note that this does not work on docker desktop due to kernel limitations.

# Create a service to expose the NFS server
# to pods inside the cluster.
